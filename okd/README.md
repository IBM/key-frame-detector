The individual B-scans of the 115 controls and 269 AMD subjects were visualised and graded as Normal, Mild (containing small drusen/pseudodrusen), Severe (fluid, PED, large drusen, GA, any sever pathological change that is extremely obvious) and NA (if quality of the image is too low to reliably grade it). 

The NA-marked B-scans are excluded from all further analysis. The Mild and Severe grades are not used in training, only in the analysis of the final results, i.e. what percentage of Mild cases were misclassified vs Severe cases? 

The Bscans were then divided up in training/validation/test sets (75%-10%-15%) 10 times. All B-scans from one volume were retained in the same split to avoid contamination of the training/testing splits
